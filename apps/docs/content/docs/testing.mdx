title: Testing & QA
description: Standards for validating components before they ship to LoveUI.
---

Quality is a first-class concern—every contribution should include automated checks and a lightweight manual review. Use this page as your checklist before opening a pull request.

---

## Local previews

Run the docs in development mode to exercise the component or pattern you are touching:

```bash
pnpm --filter docs dev
```

This command starts the Next.js docs app on `http://localhost:3000` with hot reload. Add your new examples under `apps/docs/examples/` and reference them via `<Preview path="…" />` so reviewers can interact with the change.

Need to test the CLI? Run it against a throwaway Next.js project using `npx love-ui@latest add <component>` and verify the generated files compile.

---

## Automated checks

Before pushing:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

- `pnpm lint` runs [Ultracite](https://github.com/loveconnor/ultracite) across the monorepo to enforce formatting and code style.
- `pnpm test` triggers any component-level tests registered via Turbo (unit tests live alongside packages that ship logic).
- `pnpm build` ensures the CLI bundles, docs compile, and examples stay type-safe.

If your component adds new dependencies, update `package.json` or the relevant workspace package and make sure `pnpm install` succeeds.

## Manual QA checklist

Use this quick pass for every visual component:

- **Accessibility:** Confirm keyboard navigation works, ARIA attributes are set, and focus outlines remain visible.
- **Responsive behaviour:** Resize between 320px and 1440px to ensure layout and typography hold up.
- **Dark mode:** Flip the theme switcher in the docs to check tokens and contrast in dark environments.
- **Theming:** Override tokens (e.g. `--primary`, `--radius`) locally to verify the component respects design-system inputs.
- **Docs completeness:** Update usage notes, props tables, and examples so readers immediately understand how to adopt the component.

<Callout type="warning">
If a feature depends on browser APIs (e.g. Clipboard, File System), note the requirements in the docs and guard them behind feature detection.
</Callout>

## Reviewer handoff

When you open a PR, include:

- A short summary of the change and why it’s needed
- Links to relevant docs pages or Storybook previews
- Screenshots or GIFs of the component in light and dark mode
- A note about any breaking changes or migrations required

Following this process keeps LoveUI reliable and makes it easier for maintainers to review changes quickly.
