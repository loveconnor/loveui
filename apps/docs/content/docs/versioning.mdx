description: Current release status for LoveUI.

LoveUI follows semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`), but we are still on the very first public release. This page stays intentionally lean until additional versions ship.

## Current release

| --- | --- |
| `1.0.0` | Initial launch of LoveUI, including the CLI, component catalog, examples, and documentation. |

## Staying informed

- Watch the repository to get notified when `CHANGELOG.md` updates.
