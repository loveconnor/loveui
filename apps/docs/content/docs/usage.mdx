Once you’ve installed a **LoveUI** component, you can import and use it just like any other React component.  
Because components are added directly into your project’s codebase (not hidden inside a library), you can read, edit, and customize them freely.

---

## Example

Let’s say you’ve installed the **Announcement** component — a simple dismissible banner for updates or notifications.  
Here’s how you might use it:

```tsx title="Hero.tsx"
'use client'

import {
  Announcement,
  AnnouncementTag,
  AnnouncementTitle,
} from '@/components/love-ui/announcement'
import { ArrowUpRightIcon } from 'lucide-react'

export default function Hero() {
  return (
    <>
      <Announcement>
        <AnnouncementTag>Latest update</AnnouncementTag>
        <AnnouncementTitle>
          New feature added
          <ArrowUpRightIcon
            size={16}
            className="shrink-0 text-muted-foreground"
          />
        </AnnouncementTitle>
      </Announcement>
      {/* Rest of your page... */}
    </>
  )
}
```
In this example, you import the component (and its subcomponents) from your `love-ui` folder, then compose them together in JSX.  
Because the files live inside your codebase, you can open them, tweak styles, or even add new functionality — just like your own components.

LoveUI components are **on-demand**, meaning you only include what you actually use.  
This keeps your app lean, fast, and easy to maintain.  
All components share the same theme tokens (colors, fonts, spacing, etc.), so everything stays consistent across your UI.

---

## Extensibility

LoveUI components are built to be flexible.  
Most extend the native **HTML element props** they’re based on — for example, `AnnouncementTag` extends `HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>`.  

That means you can pass any standard attributes (like `className`, `onClick`, or `style`) and they’ll just work.  
You can easily add your own functionality or styling without needing to fork or rewrite the component.

---

## Customization

There’s no extra configuration needed after installation.  
Each component includes its Tailwind CSS classes and any required scripts automatically.

You can:
- Edit the component file directly to adjust markup or styles  
- Replace or extend the Tailwind classes  
- Combine LoveUI components with your own to create unique layouts  

Everything is built to feel native — no wrappers, no hidden logic.  
You get **full control** and a **fast developer experience** from day one.
