description: How to connect LoveUI to AI tools using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
---

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that lets AI assistants like **Claude**, **Cursor**, and **Windsurf** securely connect to external tools and data sources.  

Think of it as a bridge between your AI development environment and real-world systems — allowing your AI assistant to understand and interact with your projects directly.

LoveUI includes full MCP support, so you can explore, query, and use components right from your AI tool.

---

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your AI Tool

Make sure you’re using an AI development tool that supports MCP:

- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) — free and great for beginners  
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) — AI-powered code editor  
- [Windsurf by Codeium](https://windsurf.com/) — AI development platform  
- Or any other MCP-compatible tool

---

### Step 2: Find Your Configuration File

Each AI tool stores its MCP configuration in a slightly different location:

| Tool | Configuration File |
|------|---------------------|
| Claude Desktop | `.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Windsurf | `.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` |
| Other tools | Refer to your tool’s MCP documentation |

---

### Step 3: Add the LoveUI Configuration

Add this configuration to your MCP config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "love-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://www.loveui.dev/api/mcp/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
````

This tells your AI tool to connect to the official **LoveUI MCP server**.

---

### Step 4: Restart Your AI Tool

Once you’ve added the configuration, close and reopen your AI application to apply the changes.

---

### Step 5: Verify the Connection

Try asking your AI assistant:

> What LoveUI components are available for building a dashboard?

If everything is set up correctly, it will list available LoveUI components and show examples from the docs.

---

## Using Multiple MCP Servers

You can connect LoveUI alongside other MCP servers (like GitHub or your local filesystem):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "love-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://www.loveui.dev/api/mcp/mcp"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/project"]
    }
  }
}
```

This lets your AI assistant pull from multiple sources — documentation, code, or your own project files — all at once.

---

## Usage Examples

### Get Component Info

> Show me how to use the LoveUI Button component with different variants

Your AI assistant will respond with documentation and code examples.

### Build Layouts

> Help me create a dashboard layout using LoveUI components

Your AI tool can suggest layout patterns and generate example implementations.

### Style Guidance

> What are the recommended spacing tokens in LoveUI?

Get instant access to design tokens, spacing scales, and theming information.

---

## Security and Privacy

### Data Handling

* The LoveUI MCP server **only serves public documentation**.
* No private data or code ever leaves your system.
* All communication goes through your AI tool’s secure protocol layer.

### Authentication

* No authentication is required for public component data.
* Premium or advanced features may use API keys in the future.
* Always connect using **official LoveUI MCP endpoints** for security.
