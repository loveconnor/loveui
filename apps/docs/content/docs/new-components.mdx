description: How to add new components to LoveUI.
---

Contributing new components is one of the most exciting ways to get involved with **LoveUI**.  

Maybe youâ€™ve built something in your own project â€” a **Maps widget**, an **advanced Date Range Picker**, or even a **visual Org Chart** â€” and think others could benefit from it.  
This guide walks you through how to make sure your component is a great fit and how to prepare it for contribution.

## Fit & Scope

Before contributing, consider whether your component aligns with **LoveUIâ€™s philosophy**:  
creating **composable, accessible building blocks** that power modern applications.

A few quick guidelines:
- âœ… Fits if it solves a **common use case** (e.g., inputs, editors, visual widgets)  
- âœ… Fits if it adds **meaningful functionality** missing from the core library  
- ðŸš« Avoid overly **niche or one-off** components that only serve very specific needs  

If your component helps developers build faster, cleaner UIs â€” itâ€™s probably a great fit!

## Design Consistency

Consistency keeps the library cohesive and easy to use.  

When designing your component:
- Use the same **CSS variable theme system** as existing LoveUI components  
- Follow **accessibility best practices** (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, etc.)  
- Ensure it supports **dark mode** and works across breakpoints  
- Match the overall **design tone and interaction style** of existing components  

For example, if youâ€™re adding a Color Picker, make sure it behaves and feels consistent with similar UI patterns in LoveUI.

## Documentation

Every new component needs clear, discoverable documentation.  
Include a Markdown file for the docs site with:

- A short **overview** of what the component does  
- **Installation instructions** (e.g. `npx loveui add your-component`)  
- A **list of features or props**  
- **Example usage code**  
- A **props table** (if applicable)

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Look at existing component docs for a good template.  
Great documentation ensures developers can quickly understand and use your contribution.

## Testing & Quality

Quality and reliability matter.  
Before submitting your pull request:

- Test your component manually in the docs environment  
- Check **responsive layouts** and **edge cases**  
- Verify behavior in both **controlled and uncontrolled** states (if relevant)  
- Write basic tests if you can â€” even snapshot or logic tests help  

All components in LoveUI should feel **production-ready** out of the box.

Once your PR is submitted, maintainers will review and may suggest improvements.  
Feedback is part of the process â€” it helps keep LoveUI consistent, accessible, and high-quality.  

When your PR is merged, **congratulations!** ðŸŽ‰ 
Youâ€™ve officially added a new piece to LoveUI â€” something the entire community can use and build upon.
