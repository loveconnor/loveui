description: The story, principles, and goals behind LoveUI.
---

LoveUI exists to bridge the gap between design systems and production-ready product surfaces. It started as an internal collection of reusable UI before becoming an open-source project focused on giving teams source-level control over their interface.

---

## Why it exists

- **Real source, not opaque packages.** Every install copies TypeScript + Tailwind files into your repo so you can inspect, edit, and version components as if you built them yourself.
- **Beyond base components.** Teams need workflows—dashboards, onboarding flows, sandboxes, AI surfaces—not just buttons and form fields.
- **Composable by design.** Everything is built on top of shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS so the ergonomics remain familiar and flexible.

## Origin

LoveUI was created by [Connor Love](https://github.com/loveconnor) while shipping complex dashboards and collaborative tools. The goal: share opinionated snippets that felt production-ready, yet stayed easy to customise. The library grew gradually—first base components, then feature modules, then sections and snippets tuned for real product teams.

---

## Guiding principles

1. **Own your UI.** Generated files should be indistinguishable from first-party code.
2. **Bias toward clarity.** Prop APIs, documentation, and examples should be easy to follow even for newcomers.
3. **Accessible by default.** Keyboard support, ARIA roles, and sensible focus states are table stakes.
4. **Composable everything.** Components expose slots, render props, and tokens so you can bend them to new use cases without forking.
5. **Community feedback matters.** Roadmap priorities evolve with issue discussions, analytics, and real-world stories.

## What’s next

- Grow the component catalog to cover more data-heavy and AI-centric workflows.
- Invest in theming tooling so multi-brand teams can manage palettes and typography more easily.
- Expand documentation with deeper walkthroughs, live sandboxes, and migration guides.

LoveUI is community-driven—your feedback shapes the direction. Share ideas in discussions, propose components, and help us build the UI library we all wish existed sooner.
