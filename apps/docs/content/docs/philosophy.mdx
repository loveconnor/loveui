description: The design principles that shape LoveUI.
---

**LoveUI** is guided by a set of core principles that shape how every component is designed and built.  
These principles ensure that the library stays **flexible**, **accessible**, and **developer-friendly** as it evolves.

---

## Composability

Composability is at the heart of LoveUI.  
We believe complex interfaces should be built from **small, modular pieces** that fit together naturally.

Each component does one thing well — and works seamlessly with others.  
You can nest, wrap, or extend components however you like. For example, a simple **Combobox** can stand alone or be composed with a form and a list to create a full **autocomplete search** experience.

LoveUI avoids the “monolithic component” problem where one giant component tries to handle everything.  
Instead, it follows a **lego-block philosophy** — many small, focused pieces that you can combine to build exactly what your app needs.

You’ll see this reflected in the API design:  
larger components are often made up of smaller, exported sub-components (like `AIInput`, `AIMessage`, and `AIResponse`).  
You can use the ready-made version or mix and match the parts for complete control.  

This layered approach gives both beginners and power users the flexibility they need — **simple defaults for fast use, and full composability for deep customization.**

## Simplicity

Simplicity drives every decision in LoveUI.  
A component should be easy to understand, quick to use, and straightforward to maintain.

That means:
- One import, a few clear props, and you’re ready to go.  
- Lean, readable code with minimal abstractions.  
- Preference for plain React + Tailwind over complex config or dependencies.  

For developers, simplicity means less cognitive load.  
LoveUI components follow familiar conventions (`value`, `onChange`, etc.), so you can integrate them naturally with your state management or form logic.  

And when you need to customize something?  
You can usually just add Tailwind utilities or tweak a small piece of JSX — no complicated overrides or hidden APIs.

Simplicity keeps components **maintainable, transparent, and fun to use.**

## Accessibility

Accessibility isn’t optional — it’s built in.  
Every LoveUI component follows **WCAG and ARIA** best practices out of the box.

We consider every aspect of accessibility:
- Full **keyboard navigation**  
- Proper **roles and labels**  
- **Color contrast** and **dark mode** support  
- Respect for **reduced motion preferences**  

If a component animates, it won’t trigger motion sensitivities.  
If it displays text, it stays readable in both light and dark themes.  
You can rely on LoveUI components to be **a11y-compliant by default**, saving you time on manual audits and improving usability for everyone.

Accessibility doesn’t just help users with disabilities — it creates smoother, more intuitive interfaces for all.

## Performance

Performance is a top priority.  
LoveUI components are **lightweight, optimized, and only include what you use**.

Since components are installed individually via the CLI, your bundle stays small — no shipping an entire library to the browser.  
Each piece is plain React with minimal dependencies and static Tailwind CSS classes for efficient rendering.

Under the hood:
- Components avoid unnecessary re-renders using scoped state and memoization.  
- Heavy UI elements like tables use **windowing** or **lazy rendering** for large data sets.  
- Modals, dropdowns, and other on-demand components render only when needed.  

Tailwind’s JIT compiler and tree-shaking handle the rest — your final CSS is compact and optimized automatically.

The goal: **fast to develop, fast to load, fast to use.**

## Developer Experience

We believe development should feel smooth, not stressful.  
LoveUI is designed for a delightful **DX (Developer Experience)** from setup to production.

### What that means in practice:
- **Documentation & Examples** — Clear docs with plenty of real-world examples and usage patterns.  
- **TypeScript & IntelliSense** — Full type safety, autocompletion, and inline prop hints right in your editor.  
- **Sensible Defaults** — Components just work out of the box, with configuration only when you need it.  
- **Helpful Errors** — Clear feedback when something’s misused (e.g., missing context or invalid props).  

For example, a Theme Switcher component works immediately with the standard `data-theme` attribute — no setup required.  
But if you want to customize it, you can, easily.

By prioritizing developer experience, we make sure LoveUI gets out of your way so you can focus on **building great apps, not wrestling with your tools.**

LoveUI’s philosophy comes down to one idea:  
**empower developers to build beautiful, accessible, and high-performance interfaces — faster, and with more joy.**
