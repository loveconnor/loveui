First off â€” **thank you** for your interest in contributing to LoveUI! ðŸ’–  
This project grows through community effort, and every contribution â€” big or small â€” helps make it better for everyone.

You can contribute in many ways: fixing bugs, improving documentation, suggesting enhancements, or even adding new components.  
Choose the path that best fits your skills and interests.

## Bug Reports & Fixes

If youâ€™ve found a bug:
1. Open an issue describing whatâ€™s happening and how to reproduce it.  
2. If you can identify the cause, feel free to submit a pull request with a fix.  

When submitting a PR, include a short summary of:
- The problem you encountered  
- The solution you implemented  

Clear explanations help reviewers understand and merge your contribution faster.

## Documentation Improvements

Good documentation is just as important as good code.  
You can help by:
- Fixing typos or formatting issues  
- Improving unclear explanations  
- Adding missing examples or usage notes  

If something confused you while using LoveUI, updating the docs to make it clearer for the next person is a huge help.

## Adding New Components

Built a component you think others could use?  
You can contribute it directly to the library!

Before submitting:
- Check if a similar component already exists  
- Make sure your component follows LoveUIâ€™s composable, accessible design principles  
- Include examples and prop documentation  

See [Adding New Components](#adding-new-components) for more details.

## Enhancing Existing Components

Have ideas for improvements? Awesome.  
Enhancements could include:
- Adding a new prop or feature  
- Improving accessibility  
- Refactoring for performance or readability  

For major changes, please start a discussion or open an issue first â€” that way, we can confirm it aligns with the projectâ€™s direction before you spend time on it.

## Contribution Process

We maintain a detailed [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/loveconnor/loveui/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) file in the repository.  
It covers everything from project setup to code style and pull request guidelines.
