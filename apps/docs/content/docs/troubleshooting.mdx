description: Common issues and how to fix them when using LoveUI.
---

If you’re running into problems while using **LoveUI**, this guide covers the most common causes and quick fixes.  
Most issues can be solved by checking your setup or configuration.

---

## Components Don’t Show the Right Styles

Make sure your project is correctly configured for **Tailwind 4** and **LoveUI’s base styles**.

You should have a `globals.css` file that:
- Imports Tailwind  
- Includes the LoveUI (or shadcn/ui) base styles  

If styles still don’t load, try restarting your development server to clear cached CSS.

---

## `npx loveui add` Didn’t Add Anything

Double-check the following:

- You’re running the command from your project root (where `package.json` lives)  
- Your `components.json` (if using a shadcn-style setup) is configured correctly  
- You’re using the latest version of the CLI:

```bash
npx loveui@latest
```

If it still doesn’t work, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/loveconnor/loveui/issues) so we can help.

## Theme Switching Stuck in Light Mode

LoveUI uses a `data-theme` attribute on the `<html>` element to toggle between themes.
Check that your app updates this attribute correctly and that your **Tailwind config** is using the proper selector mode (`class` or `data-`).

Example:

```html
<html data-theme="dark">
```

If you’re using a custom theme toggle, make sure it’s updating this attribute.

---

## “Module Not Found” on Component Imports

This usually means your **path alias** isn’t configured properly.
Verify that your `tsconfig.json` includes the correct alias for `@/`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Also, confirm the file actually exists in your `components/love-ui` directory.

## AI Assistant Can’t Access LoveUI Components

If your MCP-enabled AI assistant (Claude, Cursor, etc.) can’t connect:

1. Make sure your configuration file is valid JSON
2. Double-check the file path for your tool (e.g. `.cursor/mcp.json`)
3. Restart your AI application after editing the config
4. Ensure you have an internet connection — the MCP server runs remotely

---

## MCP `npx` Command Fails

Try these steps:

1. Confirm **Node.js** and **npm** are installed
2. Run `npm install -g npm` to update npm to the latest version
3. Check your system’s PATH to ensure npm binaries are included

---

## Slow or Failing Requests to the MCP Server

1. Check your internet connection
2. Wait a few minutes and try again — the server may be busy
3. If the issue continues, let us know via GitHub

---

## Still Stuck?

If none of the above helps, open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/loveconnor/loveui/issues).
Include details about your environment (Node version, tool used, and any errors you see), and someone from the team will assist you soon.
