## What are base components?

**Base Components** are the lowest-level LoveUI building blocks — buttons, inputs, switches, tooltips, and other pieces that you compose inside higher-level features and sections. They live in the `loveui` package so they can be imported directly into the docs site and any internal examples.

Unlike the installable features (Gantt, Kanban, etc.), base components stay intentionally lightweight and unopinionated. They mirror the ergonomics of shadcn/ui and Radix UI, but ship with LoveUI's Tailwind tokens, accessible wiring, and TypeScript types.

## When to reach for them

- **Design system glue:** Use base components as the starting point for new UI or when you need finer control than a prebuilt section allows.
- **Consistent UX:** They inherit tokens, motion settings, and accessibility helpers that match the rest of LoveUI, so everything feels cohesive.
- **Documentation demos:** The docs app imports base components from `loveui` to showcase core interactions without pulling in heavier features.

## Available base components

All exports live under the `loveui` namespace:

```ts
import {
  Alert,
  AuthLayout,
  Avatar,
  Badge,
  Button,
  Checkbox,
  Combobox,
  DescriptionList,
  Dialog,
  Divider,
  Dropdown,
  Fieldset,
  Heading,
  Input,
  Link,
  Listbox,
  Navbar,
  Pagination,
  PasswordInput,
  Radio,
  Select,
  Sidebar,
  SidebarLayout,
  StackedLayout,
  Switch,
  Table,
  Text,
  Textarea,
} from "loveui"
```

## Browse by category

Use the sidebar to explore base components organized by purpose:

- **Actions** - Interactive elements like buttons and links
- **Forms** - Input fields, checkboxes, switches, and form controls
- **Layout** - Dividers, headings, and text components
- **Navigation** - Navbar, sidebar, and pagination
- **Overlays** - Dialogs and dropdown menus
- **Display** - Alerts, avatars, badges, and data display
- **Layouts** - Pre-built layout structures for common patterns

## Examples

### Buttons

<Preview path="primitives-buttons" />

### Form controls

<Preview path="primitives-form" />

### Dialog

<Preview path="primitives-dialog" />

## Extending a base component

Base components are just React components inside your workspace (`packages/love-ui/components`). Copy them into your application or wrap them to suit your product's needs.

```tsx title="components/ui/button.tsx"
"use client"

import type React from "react"
import { Button as LoveUIButton } from "loveui"

export function Button(props: React.ComponentProps<typeof LoveUIButton>) {
  return (
    <LoveUIButton
      {...props}
      className="uppercase tracking-wide font-semibold shadow-sm"
    />
  )
}
```

From here you can attach analytics handlers, add design tokens, or export brand-specific variants while keeping LoveUI's accessibility and state logic intact.

## Relationship to features & sections

- **Base Components** power many higher-level LoveUI features (like Kanban or Dropzone) behind the scenes.
- **Features** are ready-to-ship, production modules that you pull in via `npx loveui add`.
- **Sections** are opinionated page slices that compose multiple features and base components together.

Use the right layer for the job — base components for bespoke UI, features for production experiences, and sections for page scaffolding.
