description: How to install and start using LoveUI in your project.

Setting up **LoveUI** is quick and flexible.  
You can install components with the **LoveUI CLI** for the fastest experience, or use the **shadcn/ui CLI** if your project already follows that workflow.

This guide walks you through what you need before installation and how to get components running in just a few commands.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your environment is ready:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) **v18+**
- A [React](https://react.dev/) project **v18+**
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) configured in **CSS Variables** mode  
  (Tailwind CSS must be set up and initialized)

<Callout type="warning">
If you haven’t set up **shadcn/ui** yet, do that first.  
Follow their [official setup guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation) to initialize Tailwind and the base components — LoveUI builds on that foundation.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
LoveUI currently supports only the **CSS Variables** version of shadcn/ui.

## Installing Components

You can install components using either the **LoveUI CLI** or the **shadcn/ui CLI** — both work the same way.  
Each command adds the selected component’s code and dependencies directly to your project.

For example, to install the **Gantt Chart** component:

<Installer packageName="gantt" />

After running the command:
- The component files will be added to `@/components/love-ui/gantt/` (or your configured components folder).
- Any required dependencies will be installed automatically.
- You’ll see a confirmation message in your terminal when setup is complete.

Now you can import and use it right away:

```tsx
import { GanttChart } from "@/components/love-ui/gantt"

export default function Example() {
  return <GanttChart />
}
