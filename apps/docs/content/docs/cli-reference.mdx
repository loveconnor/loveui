title: CLI Reference
description: Commands, flags, and expected output for the LoveUI generator.
---

The LoveUI CLI extends the shadcn/ui code generator with install recipes, dependency wiring, and quality-of-life tooling. Every command is meant to be safe to run inside your existing React/Next.js project.

<Callout type="warning">
Run these commands from the root of the project that owns your `components.json`. The CLI writes files relative to that configuration file.
</Callout>

---

## `npx love-ui add [component]`

Install one or more components into your codebase. The generator copies the component source, updates `components.json`, and installs any dependency packages.

```bash
npx love-ui add gantt
```

Sample output:

```text
âœ” Using config: ./components.json
âœ” Resolving component: gantt
âœ” Copying files into @/components/love-ui/gantt
âœ” Installing dependencies: recharts, date-fns

ðŸŽ‰ Done! Import the component with:
   import { GanttChart } from "@/components/love-ui/gantt"
```

**Tips**
- Pass multiple component names (`npx love-ui add gantt kanban qr-code`) to install a whole bundle at once.
- Use `--overwrite` if you intentionally want to replace local edits. The CLI otherwise protects edited files.

---

## `npx love-ui update`

Sync your installed components with the latest templates from the LoveUI registry. The updater compares file hashes and offers an interactive diff when conflicts appear.

```bash
npx love-ui update
```

What it does internally:
- checks the versions recorded in `.loveui/components.json`
- downloads the latest component definitions
- applies safe patches in-place
- prompts you when local modifications conflict with upstream changes

Example session:

```text
â„¹ Checking installed componentsâ€¦
â„¹ Updates available for: gantt, kanban
? Apply updates? â€º (y/N)
```

After approving, updated files are written and you can review the diff in git.

---

## `npx love-ui list`

Browse the currently published component catalog without leaving your terminal.

```bash
npx love-ui list
```

Output includes categories, install names, and short descriptions:

```text
LoveUI components
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
â€¢ announcement        â€” Marketing banner with spotlight CTA
â€¢ avatar-stack        â€” Overlapping avatars with tooltips
â€¢ collaborative-canvas â€” Multiplayer cursor canvas with presence
â€¢ gantt               â€” Project planning timeline with dependencies
â€¦
```

Use it to double-check component IDs before running `add`, or to quickly scan for new releases.

## Troubleshooting the CLI

- Delete the `.loveui` cache folder if you suspect a corrupted download; the CLI will fetch fresh templates on the next run.
- If dependency installation fails, rerun the command with `--skip-install` and install packages manually via pnpm/npm/yarn.
- For custom component folders, update `components.json` to point `style` and `outDir` to the paths you expect.

LoveUI commands are safe to rerunâ€”if something goes wrong you can inspect the generated files, tweak them, and rerun the command without fear of losing work.
