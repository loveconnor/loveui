## What is LoveUI?

**LoveUI** is a modern, open-source component library that helps you build beautiful, functional UIs faster.  
Every component is handcrafted for accessibility, responsiveness, and composability â€” with real functionality, not just styled markup.

Whether you need tables, file dropzones, or AI-driven chat components, LoveUI gives you production-ready pieces you can drop directly into your app.  
Itâ€™s built for **React**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**, making it easy to use in modern frontend projects.

## Why LoveUI?

Most UI libraries give you styles. LoveUI gives you **structure and logic** â€” components that actually do things.  
From interactive editors to complete dashboard sections, every piece is designed to save development time while keeping full control over customization.

Each component follows a few simple principles:
- **Composable:** Small parts that fit together naturally.
- **Accessible:** Built with keyboard and screen reader support by default.
- **Unopinionated:** Style it however you like with Tailwind.
- **Extendable:** Use as-is or build your own design system on top.

## What makes it different?

LoveUI isnâ€™t tied to another framework or library â€” itâ€™s a standalone system built from the ground up.  
That means youâ€™re not limited by someone elseâ€™s conventions or theme.  
You get complete freedom to design, extend, and scale your components however you need.

The library also includes **blocks** â€” pre-built sections like login pages, dashboards, or onboarding flows.  
Theyâ€™re ready to use, yet flexible enough to adapt to any project.

## Who is it for?

LoveUI is made for **developers and teams who want to move fast without cutting corners**.  
If youâ€™re building with React and want to ship polished, accessible features quickly, this library is for you.

Itâ€™s perfect for:
- Startups looking to accelerate product development  
- Developers building custom design systems  
- Teams that want consistent, reusable UI patterns

## Open Source and Community

LoveUI is fully open source under the **MIT license**.  
You can explore the code, learn from it, and adapt it however you like.  
We welcome contributions â€” from small fixes to new components.

ðŸ‘‰ Check out our [Contributing Guide](/docs/contributing) to learn how to get involved.

By building in the open, weâ€™re growing a community of developers and designers who believe in **accessible, flexible, and composable UI for everyone**.
