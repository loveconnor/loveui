description: Why developers choose LoveUI.
---

Whether you’re building a quick prototype or maintaining a large-scale product, **LoveUI** adapts to your workflow.  
Small projects benefit from fast setup and ready-to-use components.  
Larger projects gain flexibility and full control over open-source code.  

Because you only include what you use, your bundle stays lightweight — keeping performance high and load times fast.

---

## Fully Composable

Every component in LoveUI is a **building block**.  
You can combine, nest, and extend them freely to create complex UIs without being locked into rigid layouts.  

This modular approach lets you design interfaces your way — flexible, scalable, and entirely under your control.

---

## Built With Real Functionality

LoveUI isn’t just about styling — it’s about **behavior and logic**.  
Complex components like **AI chat inputs**, **Kanban boards**, or **Gantt charts** come with real interactivity built in.  

You get simple, intuitive APIs that work out of the box, so you can focus on your app’s logic instead of rebuilding core features from scratch.

---

## Intuitive & Developer-Friendly

LoveUI is designed for developers first.  
Component APIs are clear, predictable, and well-documented.  

Built with **TypeScript**, you get full **autocompletion**, **type safety**, and a familiar React + Tailwind workflow — so there’s almost no learning curve.  
That means faster builds, fewer bugs, and a smoother developer experience.

---

## Accessible & Themeable

Accessibility isn’t an afterthought — it’s part of the foundation.  
Each component supports ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility by default.  

Theming is just as seamless.  
With built-in support for **dark mode** and **CSS variable theming**, components automatically match your app’s look and feel — no extra setup required.

---

## Fast, Flexible Installation

LoveUI is modular by design.  
You can install only the components you need, keeping your project lean and maintainable.  

A simple **CLI tool** makes setup effortless — one command adds a component directly into your codebase, ready to customize.  
No bloated dependencies, no manual file copying.  
Just install, edit, and build.
