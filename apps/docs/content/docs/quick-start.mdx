title: Quick Start
description: Install LoveUI and render your first component in under two minutes.
---

LoveUI installs real component code into your project, so you can go from zero to a working UI in a couple of commands. This quick start keeps things focused: install the CLI, drop in a button, and confirm everything renders.

---

## Install the CLI and a component

Run the single command below from the root of your project:

```bash
npx love-ui@latest add button
```

The CLI will:
- scaffold the Button component under `@/components/love-ui/button`
- install any peer dependencies you are missing
- register the component in your project's `components.json` (if you are using the shadcn/ui workflow)

<Callout type="info">
The generator works in any React project that already has Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui configured in CSS Variables mode. See the full [Setup guide](/docs/setup) if you are starting from scratch.
</Callout>

---

## Use the component

Create a new page or component and import the Button you just installed:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/love-ui/button"

export default function QuickStartButton() {
  return <Button color="blue">Click me</Button>
}
```

If you are using Next.js App Router, you can drop this into `app/page.tsx` to verify the installation instantly.

<Callout type="warning">
LoveUI components follow the shadcn/ui styling system. Make sure `@/components/ui/button` still resolves to your original button if other parts of your code depend on it.
</Callout>

## Confirm it works

Open your dev server and confirm the button renders with full hover, focus, and dark-mode styles. The interactive preview below shows what you should expect:

<Preview path="primitives-buttons" />

- Explore real-world usage patterns in the [Usage overview](/docs/usage)
- Learn how to extend the design system in the [Theming & Customization guide](/docs/theming)

LoveUI ships dozens of production-ready componentsâ€”once the CLI is set up, you can repeat the `add` command for anything in the catalog.
