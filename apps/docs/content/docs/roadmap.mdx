title: Roadmap
description: Upcoming components, tooling, and documentation work for LoveUI.
---

This roadmap is intentionally lightweight—it highlights where maintainers are focusing effort. Everything is subject to change based on community feedback, real-world usage, and available contributors.

---

## Now (in progress)

- **Design token inspector:** Visualise and edit tokens from the docs site for quicker theming experiments.
- **CLI diff mode:** Preview file changes before applying `love-ui update`, making upgrades safer in large repos.
- **Accessibility audit:** Sweep core components (Button, Dialog, SidebarLayout, Table) for WCAG 2.2 compliance.

---

## Next (upcoming cycles)

- **Data-rich components:** Ship Timeline, Metric Cards, and Chart overlays tailored for analytics dashboards.
- **AI collaboration patterns:** Document best practices for handoff, history, and streaming responses when integrating LLMs.
- **Theming presets:** Publish starter palettes (modern SaaS, bold, minimal) so teams can jumpstart new brands.

---

## Later (research & contributions welcome)

- **Component testing harness:** Provide a shared Playwright configuration for cross-browser interaction tests.
- **Starter templates:** Scaffoldable app shells (dashboard, marketing site, customer portal) wired to common frameworks.
- **Plugin ecosystem:** Document how to publish third-party components compatible with the LoveUI CLI.

## How to influence the roadmap

1. Upvote or comment on issues you care about—the more signal, the higher it climbs.
2. Open an RFC for large ideas. Bring mockups, API shapes, and data to accelerate the conversation.
3. Volunteer as a component maintainer. Owning a feature area is the fastest way to ship it.

The roadmap evolves every quarter. Check back often, join discussions, and help LoveUI grow in the directions that matter most to you.
